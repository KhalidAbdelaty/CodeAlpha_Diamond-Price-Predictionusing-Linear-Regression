# Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression 💎

Welcome to my final project as a CodeAlpha Data Science Intern! In this project, I've explored a dataset of diamonds and used Linear Regression to predict diamond prices based on their features.

## Project Overview 📝

This project involves several key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: I started by loading the diamond dataset and getting a feel for its structure.

2. **Data Cleaning**: I removed diamonds that had zero dimensions.

3. **Data Visualization**: I created a pairplot and regression plots to visualize the relationships between different features in the dataset.

4. **Outlier Removal**: I identified and removed outliers in the dataset.

5. **Data Preprocessing**: I used label encoding to convert categorical data into numerical data.

6. **Model Building and Evaluation**: I built and evaluated a predictive model using Linear Regression.

## Results 📊

The Linear Regression model performed well, with an R^2 score of 0.889, indicating that it can explain about 88.9% of the variance in the diamond prices.

## Technologies Used 💻

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost

## How to Run the Project 🏃‍♀️

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook.

## Acknowledgements 🙏

I would like to thank CodeAlpha for providing me with the opportunity to work on this exciting project.
